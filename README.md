# Telco Churn Feature Engineering Analysis

### Bussiness Problem

It is desirable to develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company.
You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.


### Dataset Story

Telco churn data includes information about a fictitious telecom company that provided home phone, and Internet services to 7,043 California customers in the third quarter. It shows which customers have left, stayed or signed up for their service.

##### CustomerId : customer id
##### Gender : Gender
##### SeniorCitizen : Whether the customer is old (1, 0)
##### Partner : Whether the customer has a partner (Yes, No)
##### Dependents : Whether the customer has dependents (Yes, No)
##### tenure : Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
##### PhoneService : Whether the customer has telephone service (Yes, No)
##### MultipleLines : Whether the customer has more than one line (Yes, No, No phone service)
##### InternetService : Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No)
##### OnlineSecurity : Whether the customer has online security (Yes, No, no Internet service)
##### OnlineBackup : Whether the customer has an online backup (Yes, No, no Internet service)
##### DeviceProtection : Whether the customer has device protection (Yes, No, no Internet service)
##### TechSupport : Whether the customer has technical support (Yes, No, no Internet service)
##### StreamingTV : Whether the customer has TV broadcast (Yes, No, no Internet service)
##### StreamingMovies : Whether the client is streaming movies (Yes, No, no Internet service)
##### Contract : Customer's contract duration (Month to month, One year, Two years)
##### PaperlessBilling : Whether the customer has a paperless invoice (Yes, No)
##### PaymentMethod : Customer's payment method (Electronic check, Postal check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic))
##### MonthlyCharges : The monthly amount charged to the customer
##### TotalCharges : Total amount charged from customer
##### Churn : Whether the customer is using (Yes or No)

### Task 1 : Exploring Data Analysis

Step 1 : Examine the overall picture.
Step 2 : Capture the numeric and categorical variables.
Step 3 : Analyze the numerical and categorical variables.
Step 4 : Perform target variable analysis. (The average of the target variable according to the categorical variables, the average of the numerical variables according to the target variable)
Step 5 : Perform outlier observation analysis.
Step 6 : Perform a missing observation analysis.
Step 7 : Perform correlation analysis.

### Task 2 : Feature Engineering

Step 1 :  Take the necessary actions for missing and contradictory observations.
Step 2 : Create new variables.
Step 3 : Perform the encoding operations.
Step 4 : Standardize for numeric variables.
Step 5 : Create the model.
